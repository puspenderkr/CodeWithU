            <p class="sectinSubTag">Coding for kids (otherwise known as computer programming) is growing rapidly in
                popularity.



                While programming is offered in a small number of traditional schools in the US, a Gallup poll indicates
                that 90% of parents would like computer programming to be taught during the school day.



                Learning how to code at a young age can truly set up your child for a lifetime of success. Even if they
                don’t go into a specifically computer science related field, it gives them an edge in virtually every
                modern industry.



                Even for students who are lucky enough receive computer science instruction in the classroom, the level
                of rigor has been traditionally low (typically only Scratch, Code.org, or Tynker). To combat this, many
                parents have chosen to look for outside resources to provide coding instruction.



                The predicament that we find ourselves in is certainly not the schools’ fault. Teaching computer
                programming with real languages and tools generally requires teachers with engineering backgrounds. And
                schools simply can’t compete with the private sector which is snapping up new engineers as fast as they
                can.</p>
